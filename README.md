# NSU

Initially NSU was created as controller for a house heating system. As hardware "UDOO Dual" was chosen. Firmware runs on Arduino side of the board - SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU (same as Arduino Due). 
It also now controls the water boiler and the ventilation of the house.

## Features
### Wood boiler
Controls the combustion process and maintains the set temperature inside the boiler. This is done by controlling the exhaust fan and the ladomate.
### Water boiler
Heats the water boiler.
### Rooms temperature
Controls floor heating of each room individually.
### Winter/Summer mode
If Summer mode is on - only water boiler is heated.
### Away mode
Keeps lower temperature in the rooms.
### Touch screen
Limited set of controls can be made directly on controller touch screen, built into wood boiler.
### And more...
